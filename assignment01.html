<p>I'm a bit familiar with HTML, CSS, and Javascript from previous classes but I don't have much experience with them beyond that. Although I have been self- studying Figma's Dev mode lately and that's been giving me a better understanding of how designs translate to code. I also started to learn some Bootstrap for my on-campus job.</p>

</div>
    
<p>I'd like to learn more about CSS and Javascript to understand how to develop any designs I'd make in Figma. Specifically, I want to learn how to code CSS animations and responsive designs to better improve my work.  </p>
